## What is open source?
*Open source* means that anyone can view the source code. It means that anyone can contribute. It means that anyone can modify the source, build off of it, use it in a project, and generally just <u>do whatever they want with and/or to it.</u>

It's a framework for the collaborative and iterative manifestation of ideas in a way that makes excellent use of the time of those participating.

It's also not limited to software! There are tons of open source projects focused in part or in whole on hardware. A lot of this category can be found on [Thingiverse](https://thingiverse.com), a website that primarily hosts files for 3D printing.
## What surprised me?
I was surprised that Verizon had any involvement in the open source scene whatsoever. I don't think particularly highly of them and this doesn't change that, but it *was* surprising.

I also learned that *[Tux Paint](https://tuxpaint.org/)*--a paint program I used back in elementary school--was <u>*and still is*</u> open source! Warms the heart, doesn't it?
## Which well-known companies and projects use open source, and why does that matter?
Companies that use open source:
- [Google](https://opensource.google/)
- [Microsoft](https://opensource.microsoft.com/)
	- They own GitHub!
		- (because they bought it for billions of dollars in stock)
- [Mozilla](https://github.com/mozilla)
- [Facebook](https://opensource.fb.com/)/[Meta](https://github.com/facebook)

Projects that use open source:
  - [GNU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU) + [Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux)
  - [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/), a photoshop alternative.
  - [Marlin](https://marlinfw.org), the 3D printer firmware.

There's more benefit than just being able to vet the code of a corporation when they use open source. Their use of open source allows hobbyists and otherwise impassioned developers to improve the tools and platforms they rely on in their workflows and everyday lives. It allows them to modify the projects to their liking and occasionally to the liking of others as a fork. It brings what could otherwise be a locked-down experience into the hands of the people who experience it. In a sense, the end-users are just the beginning.
